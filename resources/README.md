# Resources
This site will take you through all resources available in this repo. If you haven't read the main page I would strongly recomend to do so before getting these files 3d printed etc.
Reason is your case may have a different dimensions which potentially may force you to tweak the CAD files to adapt them to your usecase.

**NOTE:** Files without *FreeCAD* version are not built by me personally. These files will not be stored in this repo because the license upon which these files are published must not be simply *overwritten*. An author and license info will be provided in **Additional information** column while stl links will take you to the original source of file.
